Deploying a .NET application on the Azure DevOps platform involves creating a build and release pipeline to automate the process. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set up the CI/CD pipeline for a .NET application using Azure DevOps.

### Prerequisites

1. An Azure DevOps account.
2. An Azure account.
3. A .NET application hosted in a Git repository (GitHub, Azure Repos, etc.).

### Steps

1. **Create a Project in Azure DevOps**
2. **Set Up the Build Pipeline**
3. **Set Up the Release Pipeline**

### 1. Create a Project in Azure DevOps

1. Sign in to your [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) account.
2. Create a new project by clicking on `New Project`.
3. Name your project and choose the visibility (private or public), then click `Create`.

### 2. Set Up the Build Pipeline

1. **Navigate to Pipelines**:
    - In your Azure DevOps project, go to `Pipelines` > `Pipelines` and click on `New Pipeline`.

2. **Select the Repository**:
    - Choose where your code is hosted. If it's on GitHub, select `GitHub` and authorize Azure DevOps to access your repository.

3. **Configure the Pipeline**:
    - Azure DevOps provides a YAML file to configure your build pipeline. You can either let it detect your repository’s structure and generate a template for you, or you can define it manually.

#### Example Build Pipeline (YAML)

Here’s an example of a YAML pipeline file (`azure-pipelines.yml`) for a .NET application:

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '6.x'  # Specify your .NET version
    installationPath: $(Agent.ToolsDirectory)/dotnet

- task: NuGetToolInstaller@1

- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    restoreSolution: '**/*.sln'

- script: dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
  displayName: 'Build project'

- script: dotnet test --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
  displayName: 'Run tests'

- task: CopyFiles@2
  inputs:
    contents: '**/bin/$(buildConfiguration)/**'
    targetFolder: $(build.artifactStagingDirectory)

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathToPublish: $(build.artifactStagingDirectory)
    artifactName: 'drop'
```

4. **Save and Run**:
    - Save the YAML file in your repository if it's not already there.
    - Run the pipeline to ensure it builds and tests your application correctly.

### 3. Set Up the Release Pipeline

1. **Navigate to Releases**:
    - Go to `Pipelines` > `Releases` and click on `New pipeline`.

2. **Select a Template**:
    - Choose the template that fits your deployment needs. For a simple web app deployment, you can start with the `Azure App Service deployment` template.

3. **Configure the Stages**:
    - Define the stages of your release pipeline (e.g., Development, Staging, Production).

4. **Add an Artifact**:
    - Link the build pipeline artifact. Click on `Add an artifact`, select the build pipeline you created earlier, and choose the latest version.

5. **Configure Deployment Tasks**:
    - In each stage, add tasks to deploy your application. For example, for deploying to an Azure App Service:

#### Example Deployment Tasks

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '6.x'  # Specify your .NET version
    installationPath: $(Agent.ToolsDirectory)/dotnet

- task: NuGetToolInstaller@1

- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    restoreSolution: '**/*.sln'

- script: dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
  displayName: 'Build project'

- script: dotnet test --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
  displayName: 'Run tests'

- task: CopyFiles@2
  inputs:
    contents: '**/bin/$(buildConfiguration)/**'
    targetFolder: $(build.artifactStagingDirectory)

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathToPublish: $(build.artifactStagingDirectory)
    artifactName: 'drop'

- task: AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4
  inputs:
    ConnectionType: 'AzureRM'
    azureSubscription: '<your-azure-subscription>'
    appType: 'webApp'
    WebAppName: '<your-app-service-name>'
    DeployToSlotOrASE: false
    Package: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/drop/**/*.zip'
    TakeAppOfflineFlag: true
    additionalArguments: '-o ".\wwwroot"'
```

### 4. Deploy the Application

1. **Create Release**:
    - After configuring the release pipeline, create a new release.
    - Select the build artifact and deploy it to the specified environments.

2. **Monitor the Deployment**:
    - Monitor the release pipeline to ensure that the deployment is successful.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can set up a CI/CD pipeline for your .NET application using Azure DevOps. This automated pipeline will build, test, and deploy your application to Azure, ensuring a smooth and continuous deployment process.
